**delete-branches** removes GitHub branches that have been inactive (without new commits) for longer than the idle period.

<br>

_**exemption**_
* default branch
* protected branches
* head branches in PR
* user-specified exclude branches

<br>

## ‚≠ê Why switch to delete-branches?
- we reduce your supply chain risks with `openssf best practices` in our SDLC and operations.
- we share evidence of `coverage run` test results in action (click _**Code Coverage**_ badge).

### üîç Example 2 - MOCK delete branches with no commits longer than 10 days
**Summary**
1. exclude 3 branches: `'test-1'`, `'test-2'`, `'badges'`
1. remove branches without commits longer than 10 days

**Results**
1. refine excluded branches to `{'badges'}` because branches (`test-1` and `test-2`) do not exist
1. 3 branches are exempted from delete: `main`, `badges`, `pr-branch-01`
1. 6 branches are not exempted from delete and 2 out of 6 had no commits in the last 10 days
1. mock delete 2 branches
```
(hello-world) ~/work/hello-world $ delete-branches --dry-run true --max-idle-days 10 --repo-url https://github.com/tagdots/hello-world --exclude-branches "test-1, test-2, badges"
